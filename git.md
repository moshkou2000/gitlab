## Git and GitLab

**Welcome! You will start learning more about Git and how we use it in every day work. Do not be intimidated, we have some great resources for learning. Please do keep in mind that it may take you a few days to complete this training, that is okay!**

For those new to Git and GitLab, it's important to get familiar with how Git works. You're not expected to become a GitLab master in a day, but to understand that the below is a key reference as you acclimate.]

1. [x] Make sure that the issue title follows the `<YOUR-NAME> - Git and GitLab` format.
1. [x] Assign the issue to yourself if it isn't already.
1. [x] Ping your manager on the issue and let them know that you have started this training.
1. [x] Join the [`#gitlab` channel on Slack](https://slack.com/archives/TESTOU). This is a helpful Slack channel for all your Git and GitLab questions.

### Introduction to Git and GitLab - SSH Access (familiar with Git)

1. [x] If you have never used Git before, we **recommend** you skip this step and use the [WebIDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/) to complete any Git-related onboarding tasks. The WebIDE doesn't require you to set or use any command-line tools.
   * If you plan to use Git on your local machine then you'll need to [add an SSH key to your GitLab profile](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#adding-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account). The SSH key provides security and allows you to authenticate to the GitLab remote server without supplying your username or password each time. Please note that following best practices, you should always favor ED25519 SSH keys, since they are more secure and have better performance over the other types.
   * Alternatively, you can clone over HTTPS. You'll need to generate a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.html) as account password with 2FA enabled. This method helps when SSH is blocked in your environment (e.g. hotel wifis).

### Issues: The Starting Point for your Workflow

You can use issues to collaborate on ideas, solve problems, and plan work. You can also use issues to share and discuss proposals with your team and with outside collaborators.
